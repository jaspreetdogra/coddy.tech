def knit_pattern_reversal(pattern, start_row, end_row):
    # Challenge
    # Medium
    #
    # Create a function named knit_pattern_reversal that receives pattern, start_row, and end_row as its parameters.
    #
    # You find yourself in a quaint yarn shop, surrounded by skeins of delaine wool. 
    # The shop owner has asked for your help with a complex knitting pattern. 
    # Your task is to implement a function that can reverse specific sections of the pattern, 
    # simulating the intricate process of knitting with different stitches and yarn colors.
    #
    # The function should perform the following operations:
    # 1. Reverse the order of the rows in the pattern from start_row to end_row (inclusive).
    # 2. For each reversed row, also reverse the order of the elements (stitches/colors) within that row.
    # 3. Return the modified pattern.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # pattern (list of lists of str): A 2D array representing the knitting pattern. 
    #                                 Each element is a string representing a stitch type or yarn color.
    # start_row (int): The starting row index of the section to be reversed (0-indexed).
    # end_row (int): The ending row index of the section to be reversed (0-indexed).
    #
    # The function returns a list of lists of strings representing the modified knitting pattern.
    #
    # Constraints:
    # 1 ≤ len(pattern) ≤ 100 (number of rows)
    # 1 ≤ len(pattern[i]) ≤ 100 (number of columns)
    # 0 ≤ start_row ≤ end_row < len(pattern)
    # Each element in pattern[i] is a non-empty string of length ≤ 10
    #
    # Note:
    # Be careful to handle edge cases, such as when start_row equals end_row,
    # or when they are at the boundaries of the pattern.
    #
    # Example:
    # Input:
    # pattern = [
    #     ["red", "blue", "green"],
    #     ["yellow", "purple", "orange"],
    #     ["white", "black", "grey"]
    # ]
    # start_row = 0
    # end_row = 1
    #
    # Output:
    # [
    #     ["orange", "purple", "yellow"],
    #     ["green", "blue", "red"],
    #     ["white", "black", "grey"]
    # ]

    # Step 1: Create a copy of the original pattern to avoid modifying it directly
    modified_pattern = [row[:] for row in pattern]

    # Step 2: Reverse the order of rows from start_row to end_row
    reversed_section = modified_pattern[start_row:end_row + 1][::-1]

    # Step 3: Reverse each row (stitch/color order) within the reversed section
    for i, row in enumerate(reversed_section):
        reversed_section[i] = row[::-1]

    # Step 4: Replace the original section in the pattern with the reversed one
    modified_pattern[start_row:end_row + 1] = reversed_section

    # Step 5: Return the final modified pattern
    return modified_pattern
