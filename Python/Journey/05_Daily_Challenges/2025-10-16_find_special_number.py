def find_special_numbers(n):
    # Challenge
    # Easy
    #
    # Create a function named find_special_numbers that receives n as its parameter.
    #
    # This function aims to generate a list of the first n numbers that are both perfect squares and even.
    #
    # A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. 
    # For example, 4 is a perfect square because it can be expressed as 2^2. 
    # An even number is a number that is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder.
    #
    # To solve this challenge, you can use a loop to iterate through numbers starting from 1. 
    # For each number, check if it is a perfect square and even. 
    # If both conditions are satisfied, add the number to the result list. 
    # Continue this process until you have found the first n special numbers.
    #
    # Parameter:
    # n (int): A positive integer representing the count of special numbers to find.
    #
    # The function returns a list of integers representing the first n special numbers.
    #
    # Example:
    # Input: 5
    # Output: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]

    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store special numbers
    special_numbers = []

    # Step 2: Start checking numbers from 1 upwards
    num = 1
    while len(special_numbers) < n:
        # Step 3: Check if num is a perfect square
        if int(num ** 0.5) ** 2 == num:
            # Step 4: Check if num is even
            if num % 2 == 0:
                special_numbers.append(num)
        num += 1

    # Step 5: Return the list of special numbers
    return special_numbers
