This script contains the function `redecorate_ship_name`, which redecorates a ship's name
according to specific transformation rules.

Challenge Summary:
1. Reverse the entire ship name.
2. For each word in the reversed name:
   - If it starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), keep it as is.
   - If it starts with a consonant, remove all vowels from that word.
3. Stop processing when encountering the word "dock" (case-insensitive).
4. Use loop control statements like `break` and `continue`.
