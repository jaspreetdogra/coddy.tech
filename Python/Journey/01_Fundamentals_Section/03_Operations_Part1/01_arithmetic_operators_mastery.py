# Arithmetic Operators - Mastery Challenge

# Challenge (Beginner):
# Write a code that initializes two variables, x and y,
# with the values 12.5 and 3.5 (respectively).
# After that, initialize another variable z that will
# hold the result of x * y.

# Type your code below
x = 12.5
y = 3.5
z = x * y

# Don't change the line below
print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, z = {z}")
