# Modulo Operator Challenge

# The modulo operator (%) tells you the remainder after dividing one number by another.
# Example: 10 % 3 = 1 (since 3 goes into 10 three times with remainder 1).

# Challenge (Beginner):
# Write a code that initializes three variables, a, b, and c
# with the values 9, 2, and 11 (respectively).
#
# After that, initialize:
# d = a % 2
# e = b % 3
# f = c % 10
#
# Check the result and observe how different dividends and divisors affect the remainder.

# Type your code below
a = 9
b = 2
c = 11

d = a % 2
e = b % 3
f = c % 10

# Don't change the lines below
print(f"a = {a}")
print(f"b = {b}")
print(f"c = {c}")
print(f"d = {d}")
print(f"e = {e}")
print(f"f = {f}")
