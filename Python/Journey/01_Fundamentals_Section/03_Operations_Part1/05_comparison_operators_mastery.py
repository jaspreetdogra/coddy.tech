# Comparison Operators Challenge -Mastery
# Initialize 2 variables x and y with the values 15 and 10 (accordingly).
# Then initialize another variable z that will hold whether x is less than or equal to y.

# Type your code below
x = 15
y = 10

z = x <= y

# Don't change the line below
print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, z = {z}")
