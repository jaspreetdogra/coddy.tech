# Comparison Operators

# Challenge (Beginner):
# Write a script that initializes 2 variables n1 and n2 with the values 8 and 9 (accordingly).
#
# After that initialize another variable n3 that will hold whether n1 is bigger than n2.

# Type your code below
n1 = 8
n2 = 9

n3 = n1 > n2

# Don't change the line below
print(f"n1 = {n1}, n2 = {n2}, n3 = {n3}")
