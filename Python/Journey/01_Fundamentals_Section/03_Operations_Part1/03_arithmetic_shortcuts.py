# Arithmetic Shortcuts Challenge

# Python provides shortcuts for self-arithmetic operations.
# Example:
# a = 5
# a += 3   # same as a = a + 3
#
# These shortcuts exist for all arithmetic operators:
# +=   -=   *=   /=   %=

# Challenge (Beginner):
# You are given a code with initialization of count. (Don't delete this line!)
#
# Your task is to add the following operations, in this order:
# 1. Add 4 to count
# 2. Multiply count by 2
# 3. Subtract 1 from count
#
# Use arithmetic shortcuts to do so!

# Type your code below
count = 0
count += 4
count *= 2
count -= 1

# Don't change the line below
print(f"count = {count}")
