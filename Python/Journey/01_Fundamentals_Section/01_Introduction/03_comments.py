Lesson 3: Comments

Comments are used to add explanatory notes within the code. 
They are ignored by the compiler and are meant for human understanding.

In Python, there are two ways to write comments:

1. Single-line comments using the # symbol:
    # This is a comment
    print("Hello!")  # This prints "Hello!"
    # You can use comments to explain your code
    print("Python is fun!")  # This will show on the screen

2. Multi-line comments using triple quotes ("""):
    """
    This is a multi-line comment.
    You can write multiple lines of explanation here.
    """
    print("Welcome!")
