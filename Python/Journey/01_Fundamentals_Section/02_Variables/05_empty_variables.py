# Lesson 5: Empty Variables
#
# In Python, None represents "nothing" or "no value."
#
# Example:
empty_box = None
#
# Real-world usage:
score = None  # Score not yet calculated
name = None   # Name not yet entered
#
# Challenge:
# Beginner
# Declare a variable named nothing and assign it the value None.

nothing = None
