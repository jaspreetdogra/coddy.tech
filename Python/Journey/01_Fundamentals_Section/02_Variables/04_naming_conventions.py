# Lesson 4: Naming Conventions
#
# Naming conventions improve readability and maintainability.
# Python uses snake_case for variable names (words separated by underscores).
#
# Bad examples:
isActive = False  # not snake case
a = 10
b = "Hello"
x = True
#
# Good examples:
age = 10
greeting = "Hello"
is_active = True
#
