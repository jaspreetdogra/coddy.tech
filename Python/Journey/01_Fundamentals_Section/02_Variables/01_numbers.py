# Lesson 1: Numbers
#
# Variables are containers that hold data values. They are used to store,
# manipulate, and display information within a program.
#
# A variable is like a memory unit we can access by typing the variableâ€™s name.
# Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types.
#
# Python automatically detects the variable type.
#
# To initialize a variable:
# variable_name = value
#
# Types of numbers:
# int   -> whole numbers, e.g., 1, -2
# float -> real numbers, e.g., 1.32, 0.98
#
# Examples:
a = 3       # int
b = 13.2    # float
#
# Quiz (conceptual, not code):
# Q1: What type is a = 3 ?
# Q2: What type is b = 13.2 ?
#
# Challenge:
# Beginner
# Write code that initializes a variable named var with the value 5.

var = 5
