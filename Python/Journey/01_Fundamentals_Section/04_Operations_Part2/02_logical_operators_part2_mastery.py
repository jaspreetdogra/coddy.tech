# Challenge Beginner
# Replace the values of variables a, b, and c with boolean values (True or False)
# so that result evaluates to True.
# result will be True when the expression (a or b) and not c is true.
# Use the logical operators or, and, and not to solve this challenge.

# Replace the values with booleans
a = True
b = False
c = False

# This line checks if (a or b) and not c is True
result = (a or b) and not c

# Don't change the line below
print(f"result = {result}")
